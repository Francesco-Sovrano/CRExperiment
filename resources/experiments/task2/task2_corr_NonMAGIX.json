  "ai_explanation": "<p> The system ranks destinations using a single decision rule that combines user preferences (relaxation and travel convenience) into the formula:<br> <strong>Score = 0.7 × relaxation_rating + 0.3 × max(0, (6 – travel_time) / 6)</strong> </p> <h3>Decision Process:</h3> <ul> <li>Each location is assigned a relaxation rating (0–1) and a travel time from Berlin, Germany.</li> <li>The formula applies 70% weight to relaxation and 30% to travel time (capped at 6 hours).</li> <li>The destination with the highest score is selected.</li> </ul> <h3>Outcome:</h3> <p> Nice scores approximately 0.83 (0.63 on relaxation and 0.2 for travel time), based on high relaxation and a 2-hour distance from Berlin by flight.<br> Alternatives like Mallorca or Palermo score around 0.8, so Nice is preferred. </p>"
