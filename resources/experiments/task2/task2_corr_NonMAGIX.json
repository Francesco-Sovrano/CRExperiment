  "ai_answer": "<p>Top recommendation: Nice, France</p><p>Alternates (in order): Mallorca (Spain), Palermo (Italy)</p>",
  "ai_explanation": "<p>The system applies a single decision rule that scores each candidate destination by combining the user’s priorities (i.e., relaxation and travel convenience) into one compact formula:</p><p><strong>Score(destination)</strong> = 0.8 × (relaxation_rating) + 0.2 × max(0, (6 hours – travel_time) / 6 hours)</p><h4>How the decision was taken:</h4><ul><li>It first estimates each spot’s relaxation rating (on a 0–1 scale) and its travel time from Germany.</li><li>It then computes the weighted sum above, giving 80% weight to “how relaxing” and 20% weight to “how quick” the trip is (capped at a 6 hour maximum).</li><li>Finally, it selects the destination with the highest score.</li></ul><h4>Why the decision was taken:</h4><p><strong>Nice, France</strong> has a relaxation rating of approximately 0.9 and a travel time of around 4 hours, yielding:</p><p>0.8 × 0.9 + 0.2 × ((6–4)/6) ≈ 0.72 + 0.07 = 0.79</p><p>This exceeds the scores of other beach spots. Alternatives like <strong>Mallorca</strong> or <strong>Palermo</strong> (relaxation ~0.8, travel ~2.5 h) score only ≈ 0.76 under the same rule, so Nice wins.</p>"
