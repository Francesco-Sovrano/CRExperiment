  "ai_answer": "<p>Top recommendation: Nice, France</p><p>Alternates (in order): Mallorca (Spain), Palermo (Italy)</p>",
  "ai_explanation": "<p>The system applies a single decision rule that scores each candidate destination by combining the user\u2019s priorities (i.e., relaxation and travel convenience) into one compact formula:</p><p><em>Score(destination) = 0.8 \u00d7 (relaxation_rating) + 0.2 \u00d7 max(0, (6 hours \u2013 travel_time) / 6 hours)</em></p><p><strong>How the decision was taken:</strong></p><ul><li>It first estimates each spot\u2019s relaxation rating (on a 0\u20131 scale) and its travel time from Germany.</li><li>It then computes the weighted sum above, giving 80% weight to \u201chow relaxing\u201d and 20% weight to \u201chow quick\u201d the trip is (capped at 6 hours).</li><li>Finally, it selects the destination with the highest score.</li></ul><p><strong>Why the decision was taken:</strong></p><p>Nice, France has a relaxation rating of approximately 0.9 and a travel time of around 4 hours, yielding:</p><p><em>0.8 \u00d7 0.9 + 0.2 \u00d7 ((6\u20134)/6) \u2248 0.72 + 0.07 = 0.79</em>, which exceeds the scores of other beach spots.</p><p>Alternatives like Mallorca or Palermo (relaxation ~0.8, travel ~2.5 h) score only \u2248 0.76 under the same rule, so Nice wins.</p>"
