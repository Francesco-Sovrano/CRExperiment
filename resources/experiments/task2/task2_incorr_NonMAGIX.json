  "ai_answer": "<p>Top recommendation: Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt</p><p>Alternates (in order): Azores (Portugal), Zanzibar (Tanzania)</p>",
  "ai_explanation": "<p>The system applies a single decision rule that scores each candidate destination by combining the user’s priorities (i.e., relaxation and travel convenience) into one compact formula:</p><p><em>Score(destination) = 0.90 × (relaxation_rating) + 0.10 × max(0, (7 hours – travel_time) / 7 hours)</em></p><p><strong>How the decision was taken:</strong></p><ul><li>It estimates each destination’s relaxation rating (on a 0–1 scale) and its travel time from Germany.</li><li>It computes the convenience term using 8.5 hours of travel_time, floored at 0 if it exceeds 7 hours.</li><li>It multiplies relaxation_rating by 0.9 and the convenience term by 0.1, then sums them.</li><li>Finally, it selects the destination with the highest score.</li></ul><p><strong>Why the decision was taken:</strong></p><ul><li>Sharm El Sheikh has relaxation_rating ≈ 0.98 but travel_time ≈ 8.5 h → convenience = 0.</li><li>So, 0.9 × 0.98 + 0.1 × 0 = 0.882.</li><li>Alternatives like Azores or Zanzibar (relaxation ~0.9, travel ~7–12 h) score only ≈ 0.76.</li></ul>"
