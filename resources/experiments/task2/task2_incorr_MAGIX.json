I live in Malaysia.”<br>In that earlier interaction, the AI identified the user’s desire for a nearby, restful seaside destination and recommended <em>Phuket, Thailand</em>.</p><p><strong>Case #2:</strong> “I’m based in Bangkok and want a laid-back beach break without a long-haul flight. Suggestions?”<br>Here too, the AI matched the travel-time constraint and relaxation focus, and again answered <em>Phuket, Thailand</em>.</p><p>By comparing your question’s phrasing and context embeddings with those two stored examples, the AI re-used that retrieval–and-reuse solution pattern and returned <strong>“Phuket, Thailand”</strong> as its output.</p></div>"
