Passage no. 8 reads:</p><blockquote><p>“On the wedding day, Brom wore a simple reed wreath; the mosquito a veil of glistening dew. As they reached the altar, a sinister hiss cut through the air. Serpentus, the evil snake wizard, emerged and spoke ancient words. In a swirl of emerald mist, the mosquito froze—and became a mushroom at Brom’s feet, halting the ceremony.”</p></blockquote>"
