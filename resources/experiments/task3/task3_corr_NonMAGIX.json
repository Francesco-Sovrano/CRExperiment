  "ai_answer": "The article falsely claims that the Moon’s brightness is increasing due to solar activity and secret lunar mining, leading to ecological disruption, insomnia, and even astrological imbalances. It fabricates a 12% albedo rise, unverified insomnia statistics, and suggests a nonexistent UN “Moonlight Treaty.” Additionally, it promotes baseless conspiracy theories involving surveillance and pharmaceutical manipulation, all without credible scientific evidence.",  
  "ai_explanation": "<p>To explain how and why the AI made that decision we looked for the closest past fact-checks that mirror your case. Here are the top analogues—one per claim—presented as an easy-to-read list:</p><ul><li><strong>Claim:</strong> “12% Moon brightness rise”<br><strong>Closest case:</strong> “Bright Nights Ahead” hoax; the AI marked this claim <em>False</em><br><strong>Justification:</strong> NASA observational data confirms lunar brightness has changed by less than 0.1% over the last century. The 12% figure is a viral exaggeration unsupported by scientific evidence.</li><li><strong>Claim:</strong> “Helium-3 mining whitening the Moon”<br><strong>Closest case:</strong> “Helium-3 Harvesters” claim; the AI marked this claim <em>False</em><br><strong>Justification:</strong> No Helium-3 mining missions—public or private—have occurred. The whitening effect is speculative fiction with no basis in current lunar operations or proposals.</li><li><strong>Claim:</strong> “17% global insomnia spike from moonlight”<br><strong>Closest case:</strong> “Supermoon Insomnia Epidemic”; the AI marked this claim <em>False / Unproven</em><br><strong>Justification:</strong> While anecdotal reports exist, no peer-reviewed studies have confirmed a statistically significant global insomnia spike tied to moonlight. The AI marked this as lacking empirical support.</li><li><strong>Claim:</strong> “UN passed a ‘Moonlight Treaty’”<br><strong>Closest case:</strong> Fake UN Resolution rumor; the AI marked this claim <em>False</em><br><strong>Justification:</strong> No such treaty or resolution is listed in UN documentation. Fact-checkers traced the claim to a satirical source later misinterpreted as legitimate.</li><li><strong>Claim:</strong> “Solar activity brightens Moon every 11 years”<br><strong>Closest case:</strong> NASA solar cycle report; the AI marked this claim <em>Partly true</em><br><strong>Justification:</strong> Solar cycles do influence the space environment, including radiation levels and visibility conditions, but the effect on lunar brightness is minimal and not visually apparent from Earth. The AI deemed the claim overstated.</li></ul>"
