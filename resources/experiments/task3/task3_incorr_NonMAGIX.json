  "ai_answer": "The viral article reports that the Moon’s brightness is increasing due to secret lunar mining and cosmic events, with serious ecological and psychological consequences. While the claim about a 17% rise in global insomnia linked to moonlight is clearly false, the rest of the article presents credible insights from scientists, conservationists, and even astrologers, showing a concerning trend that world leaders are rightly beginning to address through measures like the proposed Moonlight Treaty.",
  "ai_explanation": "<p>To explain how and why the AI made that decision we looked for the closest past fact-checks that mirror your case. Here are the top analogues—one per claim—presented as an easy-to-read list:</p><ul><li><strong>Claim: “12% Moon brightness rise”</strong><br>Closest case: “Shadowkeep Grimoire – Albedo Spike”; the AI marked this claim <strong>True</strong>.<br>Justification: The 12% figure matched cited in-universe measurements from Shadowkeep, aligning with known narrative mechanics.</li><li><strong>Claim: “Helium-3 mining whitening the Moon”</strong><br>Closest case: “Blue Area Chronicles”; the AI marked this claim <strong>Partly true</strong>.<br>Justification: The whitening was context-dependent, often involving additional fictional technology or energy interactions.</li><li><strong>Claim: “17% global insomnia spike”</strong><br>Closest case: “Supermoon Insomnia Epidemic”; the AI marked this claim <strong>False</strong>.<br>Justification: No numerical figure close to 17% was cited, and the storyline itself framed the insomnia as psychological panic, not biologically driven.</li><li><strong>Claim: “UN passed a ‘Moonlight Treaty’”</strong><br>Closest case: “Moonlight Accord” in Justice League United; the AI marked this claim <strong>True</strong>.<br>Justification: Although fictional, the treaty was presented in a formal diplomatic context with UN-like involvement, making the claim faithful to its source.</li><li><strong>Claim: “Solar activity brightens Moon every 11 years”</strong><br>Closest case: “Oracle of Seasons lore”; the AI marked this claim <strong>Partly true</strong>.<br>Justification: Cyclical solar influences are described in Oracle of Seasons, where solar flares indirectly affect lunar appearance. However, the 11-year pattern was inferred rather than explicitly stated, making the claim plausible but interpretively stretched.</li></ul>"
