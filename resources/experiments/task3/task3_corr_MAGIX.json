    "ai_answer": "The article falsely claims that the Moon’s brightness is increasing due to solar activity and secret lunar mining, leading to ecological disruption, insomnia, and even astrological imbalances. It fabricates a 12% albedo rise, unverified insomnia statistics, and suggests a nonexistent UN “Moonlight Treaty.” Additionally, it promotes baseless conspiracy theories involving surveillance and pharmaceutical manipulation, all without credible scientific evidence.",
