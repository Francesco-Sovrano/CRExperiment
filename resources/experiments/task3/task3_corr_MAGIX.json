    "ai_answer": "The article falsely claims that the Moon’s brightness is increasing due to solar activity and secret lunar mining, leading to ecological disruption, insomnia, and even astrological imbalances. It fabricates a 12% albedo rise, unverified insomnia statistics, and suggests a nonexistent UN “Moonlight Treaty.” Additionally, it promotes baseless conspiracy theories involving surveillance and pharmaceutical manipulation, all without credible scientific evidence.",  
    "ai_explanation": "The AI breaks the article into individual claims and checks each against trusted sources. For each claim, it computes an evidence score (E) using source relevance and authority.
